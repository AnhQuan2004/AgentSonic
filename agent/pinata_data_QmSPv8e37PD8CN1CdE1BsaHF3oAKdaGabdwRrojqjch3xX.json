  "allPostsContent": "Author: Unknown\nHey Movement Community,\nWe are Hypersign.id, a blockchain technology company specializing in Zero-Knowledge (ZK) solutions. Our team has extensive experience in building privacy-focused tools for decentralized ecosystems. Our flagship offering is an embeddable widget that enables users to complete Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, generate SNARK-based ZK proofs, and mint Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) directly on the blockchain. These innovations empower DApps to ensure regulatory compliance while providing a seamless and private onboarding experience for users.\nTo date, we have successfully deployed our solution on Nibiru, Osmosis (testnet), and Diamante blockchains. We are now keen to extend our technology to the Movement ecosystem, bringing additional utility and compliance capabilities to the community.\nWe developed custom zk-circuits tailored to KYC requirements, supporting passport and government ID documents verification from over 40 countries. Our zk-circuits currently support the following zk proofs: Proof Of Age, Proof Of KYC, Proof Of Membership, Proof Of Personhood. These zk-proofs utilize the Groth16 proving scheme, renowned for its efficiency due to minimal proof size and fast verification times. For the proving curve, we opted for BN128 over BLS12-381, primarily because it produces shorter proofs and incurs lower gas costs during verification in smart contract environments.\n969×1000 98.2 KB\nIn our CosmWasm (rust based) implementation, we leveraged the Bellman crate for proof verification. However, we had to parse and transform the proofs generated by SnarkJS to ensure compatibility with Bellman and CosmWasm. This would probably mark one of the first few smart contracts which verifies zk-snark proofs on CosmWasm contracts. We would like to convert our contracts on Move language and deploy on testnet and mainnet.\nPotential Usecases\n\nAirdrops: Ensure fair and compliant distribution of tokens by verifying participant with PoH while preserving privacy. Prevent abuse such as multiple claims or non-compliance with jurisdictional regulations.\nToken Launchpad: Enable secure investor onboarding for token sales or IDOs by verifying the identity and accreditation of participants. Facilitate compliance with local regulatory requirements for fundraising platforms.\nCompliant DEX: Allow decentralized exchanges to operate within regulatory frameworks by onboarding users who meet compliance standards. Facilitate trading without compromising user privacy through zero-knowledge proofs.\nRWA: Provide KYC checks for wrapping real-world assets (e.g., tokenizing real estate, bonds, or other securities) to ensure only compliant participants can mint or trade wrapped tokens.\n\nOther potential use cases include Blockchain Node Sales, Validators Onboarding, DAO Voting and more!\nThe proposal\nWe propose integrating our Zero-Knowledge on-chain KYC solution into the Movement ecosystem to provide:\n\n\nCompliance for DApps: Enable projects within Movement to meet regulatory requirements effortlessly.\n\n\nEnhanced User Privacy: Use ZK proofs to verify users without exposing sensitive data.\n\n\nSoulbound Tokens (SBTs): Allow users to mint SBTs as verifiable credentials post-KYC.\n\n\nThe integration will directly benefit Movement projects by improving onboarding processes, enabling compliance, and boosting user trust through privacy-preserving measures.\nDevelopment Plan\nPhase 1: Research and Planning\n\n\nAnalyze Movement technical architecture and compatibility with Hypersign.id’s solution.\n\n\nDesign custom APIs and contract integrations for Movement network.\n\n\nTimeline: 1 week\n\n\nPhase 2: Implementation\n\n\nDevelop & Deploy smart contracts for generating ZK proofs and SBT minting.\n\n\nIntegrate the KYC widget with Movement ecosystem tools.\n\n\nTimeline: 4 weeks\n\n\nPhase 3: Testing and Documentation\n\n\nTest solutions across multiple scenarios to ensure robustness.\n\n\nDevelop and publish comprehensive documentation for developers and DApps.\n\n\nTimeline: 1 weeks\n\n\nTotal Estimated Timeline: 6 weeks\n\n\nIntegration in Action\nWe deployed our on-chain KYC and ZK-based smart contracts on the Osmosis Testnet and testing for proof of personhood in few dApps in cosmos. Feel free to checkout the demo video here: https:// www. youtube. com/ watch?v=aJ1Iy3xOdyU\nLastly, I want to emphasize our commitment to data privacy. Your On-Chain ID does not contain any personal data, including your face image. Instead, users generate zk-proofs, and only these proofs are sent to the blockchain prior to minting the On-Chain ID. We have also designed the product to be as user-centric as possible (not to be confused with decentralization). We implemented a user-controlled encrypted data vault, where users securely store their data in verifiable credentials format. Access to this vault is protected by the user’s PIN / wallet, ensuring full control over their sensitive information.\nBy integrating Hypersign.id’s Zero-Knowledge KYC solution, the Movement ecosystem can achieve regulatory compliance while upholding the values of privacy and decentralization.\nResources:\n\n\nWebsite: https:// www.hypersign.id/\n\n\nDocs: https:// docs.hypersign.id/\n\n\nDemo: https:// www. youtube. com/watch?v=aJ1Iy3xOdyU\n\n\nCompany Name: Hypermine Labs (https:// hypermine. co/) - LinkedIn (https:// www. linkedin. com/company/hyperminetech)\n\n\nIn conclusion, we hope to gather valuable feedback from the community through this forum post. If the response is positive, we plan to proceed with raising a proposal on the mainnet and hopefully contribute positively to the Movement ecosystem. Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter @bhushan_vishwas\nThank you!\nHi bro,\nFirst of all thanks for showing your interest and apologies for replying late. I went on vacation right after raising the proposal.\nBack to your questions:\nWhere we are:\n\nMost of work related to research  is finished, which includes implementing custom zk circuits for kyc data, verifying zk proofs etc.\nFinished all UI work as well including a nice dashboard for admin to see the data, a widget UI for users to complete KYC and generate zkps etc.\nApart from that we implemented multi tenant based architecture so that there is complete data segregation and should comply with GDPR and other regulations.\nFinally we have also implemented the entire flow based on Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) framework, including DIDs and Verifiable credentials for better interoperability.\nAll our contracts are written in Rust for Cosmwasm.\n\nWhat need to be done:\n\n\n\nWe need to implement/migrate contracts in Move (this would be major work for us).\n\n\n\n\nNeed to give support for Aptos ecosystem wallets (probably need to integrate razor wallet kit?) in both Admin dashboard (where dApps deploy KYC contracts)  as well as in the KYC widget (where users mint SBTs)\n\n\n\nimage1341×781 118 KB\nBasically these contracts we would develop and integrate with UI.\nWhat we need:\n\nBit of development support in the form of grants\nMarketing support\n\nYes sir, but I am not sure how do I send DM here on this forum. \ninteresting the technology and also your developement duration\n\nAuthor: Aptos\nMaking Moves with @MoveBit_ and @MovemakerHQ \n\nBringing Aptos to @consensus_hk, and bringing Aptos to more and more people around the globe.
